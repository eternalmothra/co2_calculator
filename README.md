co2_calculator
==============

calculates how much CO_2 you save by riding instead of driving!

Just plug in how many miles you've traveled, and what your mpg would be if you had used your car. The calculator tells you
how many gallons of gas you didn't use, and how much carbon dioxide you didn't put into the air!
